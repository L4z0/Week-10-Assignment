* For this particular assignment, I was able to learn about a search engine called Shodan that allows you to search about services 
  and ports available to the IP address. The Darknet was an interesting read; trying to set up tails and configure it properly with
  Tor and what would have surpass the time required to submit. I've known for a while that though you may use Tails and or Tor, you 
  are still not all the way secured from being Identified. I have read cases in which the FBI have figured out a way to reverse 
  engineer these anonymity tools to still track perpetrators in order to bring them to justice. As for bitcoin, I have done extensive 
  study to understand blockchain, how it works, and how bitcoin implements the blockchain, to an extent; but the new thing I did not
  know is that there is a process called TUMBLING in which a third party "launders" bitcoin by passing it through multiple transactions
  in order to obsure its origin. This is something that I will be looking forward to learning more about on my own since the so called 
  blockchain is the "most secure, immutable" wave of technology to come. I found something better, but it is not widely talked about 
  due to unknown reasons, well for me. Check this out and determine whether you think this is up to par or better than blockchain:
